files, log files, etc.


What does fast-forward in Git mean?
If Master has not diverged, instead of creating a new commit, git will just 
point master to the latest commit of the feature branch. This is a “fast forward.”



Why should you have different branches?
It helps the teamates to work on different modules and this will not effect others work.
